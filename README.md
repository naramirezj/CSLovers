# CSLovers
Final Mobile Software Development project in Kotlin through Android Studio.

## Architecture
- Created Retrofit end-points within the application and sent GET requests to The Muse public API. Exctracted job postings changing the query parameters based on user input. 
- The user will log in to the app through Firebase authentification and indicate their preferences through a drop-down. Then the user will see the feed with various job posts and can indicate if they are interested in the job or not.
- If they are interested the job will be saved in their "SavedJobs" screen.
