#CSLovers
Final Mobile Software Development project in Kotlin through Android Studio.

##Architecture
Created Retrofit end-points within the application and sent GET requests to The Muse public API. Exctracted job postings changing the query parameters based on user input. 
The user will login to the app through Firebase authentification and indicate their preferences through a drop-down. Then the user will see the feed with various job posts and can indicate if theyr are interested in the job or not.
If they are interested the job will save in their "SavedJobs" screen.
